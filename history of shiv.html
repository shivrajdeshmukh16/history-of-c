In the early 1990s, a physicist named Tim Berners-Lee came up with an idea
 of how people could share and access information globally when he was working
 at CERN in the early 1990s. His idea was the World Wide Web, which he made 
possible by introducing HTML in 1991. HTML made it possible to organize
 documents using straightforward markup tags, allowing users to navigate
 between related documents easily.
